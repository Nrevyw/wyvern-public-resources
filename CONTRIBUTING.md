# Introduction

Wyvern welcomes open and collaborative additions to our public resources. If you
notice that we are missing something important in our documentation, feel free
to let us know!

## What We're Looking For

We want folks to be able to easily use our data across all platforms and software
packages, open or closed source. If you have developed code for your specific
use case with Wyvern data, we would be honored to showcase it to the rest of
the world.

# Ground Rules

- Any relevant programming language is acceptable (especially R and Python!)
- [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) formatting if written in Python
- Code and tutorials should be easy to understand and get running, with relevant
packages/version control attached to the code.
- Separate directories for separate themes/ideas/languages.
- We may further modify your contribution before merging it into the repo to 
ensure maximum readability & accessibility.

# Conclusion

Happy Coding!
