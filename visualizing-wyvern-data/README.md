## Setting Up Your Environment

1. Install anaconda (or miniconda/other variants; when in doubt, install anaconda)
2. Create an environment for this project by running the command: `conda env create -f environment.yml`.
This will create an environment named `wyvern_viz_env` and install the required packages to ensure all
code in this folder runs correctly.
3. If this environment does not show up in your editor of choice (Jupyterlab, Visual Studio Code), add it
by following the relevant instructions for your editor.
4. You're ready to run the code!
