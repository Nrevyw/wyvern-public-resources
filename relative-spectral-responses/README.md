# Relative Spectral Response Curves

This subdirectory holds CSV files containing theoretical relative spectral responses (RSR) for each band
on Wyvern's imagers.

Relative spectral response curves depict how sensitive a band on a detector is to different wavelengths
of light. Below is a visualization of the RSR curves for Wyvern's first three satellites:

![Dragonette-003 relative spectral response of all bands on imager.](../media/drag_003_rsr.jpg)
